# TypeScript Project Template
This repo will get you started on your next TypeScript project. To use it, I follow these steps:

- In WebStorm, create a new project from a Git repository. Use this repo's URL as the repo to clone.
- Open file ``src/package.json``. Notice that a prompt pops up in the bottom-right corner of WebStorm:


    Install dependencies
    From src/package.json
    Run 'npm install'     Don't ask again
  
- Select ``Run 'npm install'``.
- Open file ``src/test/renameme.spec.ts``. Admire its 0 lines of executable code. Remind yourself that 0 lines of code means you have 0 bugs in your code. Congratulate yourself. You rock!
- Enjoy.
