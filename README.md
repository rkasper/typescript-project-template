# TypeScript Project Template
This repo will get you started on your next TypeScript project. To use it, I follow these steps:

- In WebStorm, create a new project from a Git repository. Use this repo's URL as the repo to clone.
- Open file 'src/package.json'. Notice that a prompt pops up in the bottom-right corner of WebStorm:

  Install dependencies
  From src/package.json
  Run 'npm install'     Don't ask again
  
- Select "Run 'npm install'".
-
